# HandReceipt - Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management

HandReceipt is a dual-use blockchain application designed for both military property management and civilian supply chain operations. It leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient system for tracking assets and managing transfers.

## Core Features

### Military Use Case
- Digital Hand Receipt Management
- Property Book Integration
- Sub-Hand Receipt System
- QR Code-based Asset Tracking
- Chain of Custody Tracking
- Compliance with Military Standards
- Secure Authentication and Authorization
- Unit/Organization Structure Management

### Civilian Use Case
- Supply Chain Management
- Inventory Tracking
- USDC Integration for Payments
- Smart Contract-based Transactions
- Supplier Management
- Purchase Order System
- Real-time Asset Tracking
- Digital Twin Technology

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- React Native for mobile applications
- QR Code scanning and generation
- D3.js for data visualization

### Backend
- Rust for core business logic
- Blockchain integration (Hyperledger Sawtooth)
- Smart Contract System
- RESTful API

### Blockchain
- Digital Twin System
- Smart Contracts for:
  - Property Transfers
  - Payment Processing (USDC)
  - Asset Verification
  - Chain of Custody

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Rust

This is a description of my app â€” HandReceipt

Goal: Develop a secure, blockchain-based system for tracking property, ensuring high availability, enabling offline operation, and providing robust auditability.

Meant to be a secure military property management system using QR codes and blockchain verification. (mobile-first with offline support). Where QR codes or barcodes are affixed to property which, when scanned, prompt a transfer request to be sent to the current person assigned that property. (And Transfer Workflow =
 - QR code scanning for transfers with mobile, transfer approved or denied
* transfer "sent" to the backend where sawtooth blockchain uses PoET to verify and record the transfer.)


QR codes or barcodes are generated only by "officer" users (RBAC) and are linked to a digital twin of a piece of property
