AESTHETIC DESCRIPTION: I am aiming for a sophisticated, minimalist military-grade aesthetic with these key characteristics:

1. Pure Black Foundation
- Deep, pure black backgrounds (#000000)
- Stark white text and borders for maximum contrast
- Minimal use of color to maintain authority and professionalism
- Clean, uncluttered spaces that emphasize content

2. Minimalist Elements
- Simple, boxed containers with thin white borders
- Subtle transparency in interactive elements
- Deliberate use of whitespace
- No unnecessary decorative elements
- Elegant serif typography for branding

3. Military-Inspired Hierarchy
- Clear, authoritative typography
- Role-based interface elements
- Essential status indicators only:
  - Warning: #FFD700 (amber alerts)
  - Error: #FF3B3B (critical notifications)
  - Neutral: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7) (secondary text)

4. Professional Typography
- Serif font for branding elements
- Sans-serif for interface elements
- Measured letter-spacing for readability
- Careful use of font weights
- Uppercase used sparingly for emphasis

5. Minimal Interactive Elements
- Simple hover states with opacity changes
- Clean, borderless input fields
- Subtle transitions
- Clear visual feedback
- High contrast for important actions

6. Structured Layout
- Centered, symmetrical composition
- Consistent vertical rhythm

The overall aesthetic combines military precision with modern minimalism, creating an interface that feels both authoritative and refined. It emphasizes functionality and clarity while maintaining a sophisticated, professional appearance that's appropriate for military applications.
